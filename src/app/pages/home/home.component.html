        I'm a passionate software engineer and Bachelor of Science student. It all started with my apprenticeship as a
        software engineer at Centris AG, where I built a strong foundation in software development. Most recently, I
        worked as a Junior Software Engineer at MySign AG, where I developed and maintained the company's e-commerce

        At MySign AG, I had the opportunity to expand my knowledge of software development for one and a half years.
        MySign AG is known for its customizable e-commerce solutions. I expanded my Java skills and gained hands-on
        experience in microservice development using Apache Camel and Spring Boot for cloud-based applications.
        Additionally, I explored new technologies such as the Ionic Framework for mobile app development. I also took on
        the role of technical project manager and managed communication between interface partners.
