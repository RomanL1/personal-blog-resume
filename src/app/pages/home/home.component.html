        I'm a passionate software engineer and Bachelor of Science student. It all started with my apprenticeship as a
        software engineer at Centris AG, where I learned the basics of software development. At last I worked as a
        MySign AG, where I was responsible for the development and maintenance of the company's e-commerce applications.
        In addition to my job, I am studying part-time for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at
        the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

        At MySign AG, I had the opportunity to expand my knowledge of software development for a year and a half. MySign
        AG is known for their customizable E-Commerce solutions. My know-how in Java could be expanded and I also had
        the possibility to learn new technologies like the Ionic Framework in app development or the development of
        microservices with Apache Camel in combination with Spring Boot for the cloud. I also took on the role of
        technical project manager and was responsible for the communication between the interface partners.
